# hampp
Robotic hamster to give you financial advice.

I am not liable for any advice that the hamster gives. Follow at your own peril.

# Description

Hampp is a program that was based on the story of the hamster cage that enabled a hamster to buy/sell crypto. With the assumption that
the story's hamster was not cognizant of its decisions and was enabling a random selection, I've made hampp randomly select crypto for you.
Since we're dealing with real money here, I didn't want to play around with shabby and predictable pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs): I've 
opted to use a cryptographically secure PRNG to ensure the highest quality of randomness. As I believe in DCAing, and because I've already gotten 
bored and don't want to update hampp, there isn't a sell option in the robo-hamster's wisdom and it equally divides any investment amount you give it. 

Have fun and remember: ***this is not financial advice***.
